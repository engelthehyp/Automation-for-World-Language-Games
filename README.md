# Automation for World Language Games

A collection of userscript that automate playing games or allow you to perform useful actions on the World Language Games site.

These userscripts will automate the playthrough of their respective games.
There are also some other tools, which let you do things like select your name automatically and let you play games that have been disabled.

## Games I've automated

- ~~Millions (Adds random time between *1:00* and *3:59* and a random amount of wrong guesses between *0* and *4* for realism)~~ Millions has had its constuction changed, so this script will no longer work. I might be able to make a new script for the new Millions game sometime.
- Basketball (Which is no longer under construction. **The old script works exactly as well** as the new one, so both the old and new scripts are the same. That's good, no adaptation needed. It does make me wonder what was changed, though.)
- Ping-Pong (Slower, but **plays the game** for you, most useful in the classroom)

## Tools I've made

- Name Auto-select
- Disabled Games Launcher
- Leave OLT Page
