# Automation for World Language Games

[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/engel03455/Automation-for-World-Language-Games?branch=main)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

Are you tired of doing your World Language Games? I know I *was*. Do you wish you had a tool to do them for you? Well, now your wish has come true!

These userscripts will automate the playthrough of their respective games.
There are also some other tools, which do things like select your name automatically and let you play games that have been disabled.

## Games I've automated so far

- ~~Millions (Adds random time between *1:00* and *3:59* and a random amount of wrong guesses between *0* and *4* for extra realism!)~~ Millions has had its constuction changed completely, so this script will no longer work. I might be able to make a new script for the new Millions game sometime.
- Basketball (Now, that game is no longer under construction. **The old script works exactly as well** as the new one, so both scripts are exactly the same, which is good. It does make me wonder what was changed, though.)
- Ping-Pong (Ultra realistic, actually **plays the game** for you, takes a bit of time but is completely undetectable, even if the teacher is looking over your shoulder)

## Tools I've made so far

- Name Auto-select
- Disabled Games Launcher
- Leave OLT Page (New!)

I hope they come in handy for you.
