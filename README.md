# Automation for World Language Games

A collection of userscripts that automate playing games or allow you to perform useful actions on the World Language Games site.

These userscripts will automate the playthrough of their respective games.
There are also some other tools, which let you do things like select your name automatically and let you play games that have been disabled.

## Games I've automated

- ~~Millions Adds random time between *1:00* and *3:59* and a random amount of wrong guesses between *0* and *4* for realism~~ Millions has had its constuction changed, so this script will no longer work. I might be able to make a new script for the new Millions game sometime.
- Basketball: Please note - the Basketball game has been updated. I have issued a patch for the update. I will keep the previous script separate as a defunct script.
- Ping-Pong: Slower, but plays the game for you. Most useful in the classroom.

## Tools I've made

- Name Auto-select
- Disabled Games Launcher
- Leave OLT Page
